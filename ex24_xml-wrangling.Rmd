```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Will be based on:

Overview:

  * Wrangle XML from the Google Sheets API
  * XPath to isolate XML nodesets as elements of a list
    - each element contains data for one row of a Google Sheet
    - wrapped in great gobs of thoroughly namespaced XML
  * Use `map()` on that list with more XPath to retain only nodes from `gsx` namespace
    - these nodes contain actual cell data
  * Use `map()` at depth 2 to extract sub-node names and text
  * `unnest()` to go from one row per Sheet row to one row per Sheet cell
